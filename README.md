# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and including 
coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. 80 % 
of CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, 33 % of these deaths occur prematurely in people 
under 70 years of age. Deploying machine learning models, we can successfully predict the probability
of heart failure with high accuracy. Use of data driven solutions can be the answerto the rising number 
of deaths related to the CVDs. Correlation matrices can be employed to ascertain the importance 
aspects of disease and to focus on them to increase the accuracy of the models. Increased capacity of 
the computing environment both in terms of software and hardware can be leveraged to run complex 
algorithms and helping in the improvement of health world over
